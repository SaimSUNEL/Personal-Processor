# Personal-Processor
A MIPS-Architecture-like Experimental Processor and its Assembler Implementation

An experimental MIPS-like processor architecture has been implemented on Logisim.
Instruction are inspired from MIPS assembly.
An ANTLR-based assembler has been implemented in order to program processor. 
Assemler yields a myprocprogram.output. This file needs to be load into ROM memory of processor.
Processor and Assembler documentation will be prepared later. LedBlink example turns on and off a led connected to port A of processor.  

Tools:
  - Eclipse Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2)
  - Antlr 4.5.3
  - JavaSE 1.8
